                        Fate and Forage is a book full of data tables which can be used to generate storytelling elements with dice rolls. It ca be used to inspire, direct, or otherwise add flavor to existing or new TTRPG games. The book has a lightly suggested low fantasy world theme but can be easily adapted to any campaign with a little bit of creativity. Use the random tables in this book as jumping off points for your own campaign ideas or to bring an element of randomness to your campaigns.
